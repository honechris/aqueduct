## Tasks

The Aqueduct command-line utility creates projects, runs applications, manages database schemas and other tasks.

This tool is installed through `pub`:

```
pub global activate aqueduct
```

The above command updates the tool if a new version is available. You should ensure that `aqueduct` and your application use the same version of Aqueduct.

All command-line tools have a `--help` option to show their options.
